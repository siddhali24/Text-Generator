# Robert Frost Inspired Text Generation

This project is a simple text-generator build using Hugging Face Transformers  in Google Collab to generate new poetic text inspired by the works of Robert Frost(uploaded dataset).

## Overview

- Loads Robert Frost’s poems from a CSV file.
- Uses a pre-trained transformer model (GPT-2) from Hugging Face.
- Given a poem line or prompt, the model generates new text in a poetic style.
- Demonstrates natural language generation with deep learning.
- Runs entirely in Google Colab for easy use.
- Uses Hugging Face’s `pipeline` for text generation.

## Example:
Input prompt: "Whose woods these are I think I know."
Output: "Whose woods these are I think I know. And what do they look like in the future? I'll give you one thing..."
